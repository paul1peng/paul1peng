## Hi! I’m Paul.

I am a contemporary artist working in experimental furry drawing as well as a software developer with a soft spot for type theory and hand-coded generative art. This is where I wear the latter of these two hats.

I am in the middle of archiving here various [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) sketches and in-progress programming language projects that I’ve written over the past few years for my own enjoyment. One of those sketches is [already here](https://github.com/paul1peng/center) and [can be viewed here](https://paul1peng.github.io/center/). Check back for when I’ve added more of them!
